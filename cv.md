## About me
After almost 17 years of working at one place (starting as assistant and finishing as project manager), I decided that I want changes in my life (and job). I want to create something and be useful, to see how my work makes websites better. I'm highly motivated to become a front-end developer and be useful in the company where I will work soon.

I'm responsible person, my boss and colleagues counted on me during my work. That's why I was promoted up to project manager. I like to find out something new every day, so I will learn new things all the way!

  return a * b;
